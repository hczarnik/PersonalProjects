This project is written in Python. The purpose of the project is to allow for information to be retrieved from the NHL API.
A writeup of that API can be found here: https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/blob/master/stats-api.md
One of the links of the API can be found here: https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams/

To read the data from the website, JSON is used to retrieve the data, which then allows Python to read and access the data.
